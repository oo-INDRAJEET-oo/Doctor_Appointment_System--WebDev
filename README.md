# Doctor_Appointment_System--WebDev_Project
To create a Doctor Appointment System using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and SQl.

End-Semester Project of my Internet Programming course.

**Used HTML + CSS + JavaScript to build the front end of the site and PHP for the backend with SQL supporting the database.**

It lets a user choose any speciality docotor and then choose the time and date to get an appointment with any doctor of their wish.</br>
It also projects the details of the doctors available and dynamically changes the day and time a specific doctor is available/free.</br>
All this works just by using SQL and Vanilla-Javascript.</br>
The project and code still needs a uplift with other featres to be added but this was done to utilise the tech I learned during Internet Programming course.
